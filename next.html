    <h1>Mozilla Developer Tools Q4</h1>
    <p>Kevin Dangoor, October 28, 2010</p>
    <p>For Mozilla's developer tools group, the July to September quarter (Q3) of 2010 was a time of very quickly getting up to speed and working to land something new in Firefox 4, which had already started down the track of public beta. That work is wrapping up soon, and in the October to December quarter (Q4), we're starting to turn our attention to what's next.</p>
    <p>Nothing here is written in stone. We're an open organization, and this is out for public commentary. Think we should do something different? <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-apps-firefox">Let us know!</a>. Don't feel like signing up for a mailing list? You can email me directly: <a href="http://scr.im/kdangoor">k...@m...a.com</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Finishing up Firefox 4</h2>
    <p>While the most interesting part of this document is "what do we do next?", I want to emphasize the most important work we have for the quarter: finishing up Firefox 4. We need to clear our list of Firefox 4 bugs for the Web Console and help ensure that there's a compatible Firebug release when Firefox 4 comes out.</p>
    
    <h2>Electrolysis, devtools APIs and keeping Firebug running</h2>
    <p>Since devtools are designed to help developers with their web content, they universally are going to have code that accesses content and generally puts up some kind of user interface. The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis">electrolysis</a> (e10s) work will break a good bit of this code, making calls that used to be synchronous now asynchronous. Firebug will be broken. The Web Console will be broken. And so on...</p>
    <p>If we build a new set of APIs that is geared toward developer tools, we can plan for the coming of e10s today. With the right planning, e10s will just mean rewiring what's <em>behind</em> some of those APIs, requiring no changes to the developer tools themselves. Creating new APIs also gives us a chance to put together a coherent interface that makes it much easier for web developers to create new tools for Firefox.</p>
    <p>An e10s-ready API is vitally important for Firebug, which is a large project. By starting work on these APIs today and building them out with everything Firebug needs, we can help get Firebug running atop of an e10s base.</p>
    <p>The Firebug project members have a great deal of experience in building web developer tools in JavaScript and their input and assistance on the new APIs will be invaluable. In fact, the Firebug project has already begun work designing a "browser tools interface" which will have features very similar to the features we would need in a developer tools SDK.</p>
    <p>Designing and building a "devtools SDK" that presents these APIs is going to take more time than just this quarter. But, we plan to kick this off during the quarter.</p>
    
    <h2>Integrated Developer Tools</h2>
    <p>Firefox is the only major browser that ships without developer tools. Firebug has led the pack and the other browsers' tools mimic Firebug in many ways. The existence of Firebug means that Firefox is not truly without developer tools and buys us time to incorporate the best aspects of the existing tools and to try some new directions.</p>
    <p>One example of a new direction: "web designers" need tools as well, to help their pages get the look they're going for. Firebug offers far more than what designers need and our work on the Inspector tool has been specifically geared toward the web designer audience.</p>
    <p>As much as possible, we'd like to have the integrated Firefox developer tools share and work with Firebug. Our top priority is to ensure that the tools that ship with Firefox provide a great user experience for a diverse set of web developers.</p>
    <p>"Integrated" also has another meaning here: the Web Console and Inspector were initially designed as two mostly separate tools that had a handful of integration points. As we add a debugger to the mix, we will want to ensure that the separate tools can work together comfortably without visually burdening the user when they are focused on the work provided by one tool.</p>
    <p>In order to ensure that we're heading a good direction with the user experience, we will do more interaction design work that we can get feedback on before we start building out the integrated tools. We also plan to build the tools as Jetpacks, making them easier to install and try out than special test builds of the browser.</p>
    <p>During this quarter, we'll be kicking off the design work for our new tools and also releasing some initial code based on our work on the Inspector project during the summer.</p>

    <h2>Skywriter now and in the future</h2>
    <p>&lt;textarea&gt;s just don't cut it for editing code, and yet more and more code is being edited in the browser. The <a href="https://builder.mozillalabs.com/">Firefox Addons Builder</a> is one example. Another is the Inspector feature that was originally planned for Firefox 4. It includes an on-demand CSS editor. While we <em>could</em> defer editing to the host operating system, an editor that's all JavaScript is one that web developers can comfortably extend. It can also provide a consistent user experience on all platforms, even on devices like the iPad.</p>
    <p>Skywriter is the leading choice for an in-browser editor today because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Skywriter is fast, even on large files</li>
      <li>Skywriter has the basis for most common, powerful editor features (eg, custom keyboard mapping, code completion)</li>
      <li>The plugin and settings systems allow the editor to be tailored based on different user needs</li>
      <li>Plugins also allow the editor to be tailored for different application needs (for example Addons Builder vs. Inspector)</li>
      <li>Skywriter is designed in a way that makes it possible to operate with any kind of web server, in a desktop (XULRunner) environment or with a custom server that provides seamless sharing of plugins with the client</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A goal for Q4 is to come up with an overall plan for the project. In general, we need to ensure that we have access to a high-quality, extensible editor. We have started working with Ajax.org to share code between Skywriter and their <a href="http://github.com/ajaxorg/editor">Cloud9 code editor</a>.</p>

    <h2>Bringing developer tools builders together</h2>
    <p>Developer tools cater to a different audience with different skills and needs than Firefox as a whole and we should work to create a community of web developers who wish to <em>own</em> their tools. These developers will feel empowered to not just complain that "this tool doesn't handle my situation" and instead expand the tool to help them out.</p>
    <p>To bring this community together, we can:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>make it easy for web developers to apply the skills they already have</li>
      <li>document the specifics of how they apply those skills</li>
      <li>be where they are</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Jetpack, already gives us #1 as Firefox's future extensions platform. It makes it easy for web developers to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a fun, restartless environment to extend the browser.</p>
    <p>New, documented APIs in the Jetpack style for tasks like debugging, profiling and inspecting page content will give tools creators a stable base to rely on. Firebug's developers have had to dig deep into Firefox in order to create Firebug and have run into trouble as the only users of various APIs. The new APIs will make it easier for web developers to experiment with new developer tool interactions without climbing a steep learning curve. As previously mentioned, these APIs will also shield developers from the changes coming with e10s.</p>
    <p>By building our own developer tools with these APIs, we will have full-featured examples that we can point to as people are learning the new APIs. We'll also be inviting a broad set of developers to join us in building some awesome tools for the web. Building Firefox should not be a prerequisite to helping make the Inspector the best way to track down trouble with page designs.</p>
    <p>We should go where many leading edge web developers are. By putting our source code up on GitHub, we will put our work in a familiar place where people are used to working with the source code provided by others. The tools and social network at GitHub make it easy for developers to freely collaborate with one another. Jetpack itself <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla-labs-jetpack/msg/b591c409c4d502e9">is planning a move to GitHub</a>, so we won't be alone in making this move.</p>
    <p>When the time comes that we decide to ship some collection of the tools we build with Firefox directly, these tools  will be migrated from GitHub into mozilla-central with the rest of Firefox. Our intention is to leave the code structured as a Jetpack, and we need to investigate exactly how that will work. Tools that we are not shipping with Firefox will remain on GitHub, similarly to how Labs projects are handled today.</p>
    <p>In Q4, we plan to start work on the devtools APIs for Jetpack and the updated Inspector tool on GitHub.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Q4 2010, in short</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Firefox 4 (Web Console)</li>
      <li>Firebug on Firefox 4</li>
      <li>New devtools API project on GitHub</li>
      <li>Functional specs for new integrated, developer tools set</li>
      <li>Start of work to stand the Inspector up on top of new devtools APIs, including an early CSS editor release</li>
      <li>Plan for Skywriter's future</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Open questions</h2>
    <p>In trying to create features that cater to the needs and skills of developers and to make it as easy as possible for those developers to join in on creating the best tools around, we're consciously doing some things that are different from what Mozilla has traditionally done. We haven't encountered anything that makes us think our plan is unworkable, but we do have some open questions to resolve.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jetpack is still new and not yet fully stable. How much trouble will that cause us?</li>
      <li>For tools that we ultimately do ship with Firefox, how will we incorporate them into the product?</li>
    </ul>
