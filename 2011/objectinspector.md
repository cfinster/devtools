# Object Inspector Plus #

The Object Inspector allows the user to browse a JS object's properties.
The Web Console in Firefox 4 includes an object browser, but we would
like to make improvements to that browser. It needs to become
e10s-ready and should do a better job of handling updates to an
object's state.
