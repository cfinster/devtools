        <h1>Style Fix Workflow</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Jane Goodeye is a designer first and foremost, but she has managed to work her way around HTML and CSS to get what she wants.</p>
        <p>Jane has a page with a headline that should be blue but is red.</p>
        <div class="page">
            <h1 style="color: red">The Wrong Color</h1>
            <p>This text is unimportant. It may as well be Lorem.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Jane gets to the Highlighter via the context menu</p>
        <div class="page">
            <h1 style="color: red">The Wrong Color</h1>
            <ul class="menu" style="position: relative; left: 20px; top: -50px; width: 150px; margin-bottom: -20px">
                <li>Lorem</li>
                <li class="selected">Inspect Element</li>
                <li>Ipsum</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This text is unimportant. It may as well be Lorem.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The Highlighter displays with appropriate annotations and
        such. There are buttons to display tools for that element.</p>

        <div class="page inspector">
            <h1 style="color: red" class="inspected">The Wrong Color</h1>
            <ul class="menu" style="position: relative; left: 20px; top: -10px; width: 150px; margin-bottom: -20px">
                <li>CSS Inspector</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This text is unimportant. It may as well be Lorem.</p>
        </div>

        <p>With a click, the CSS Inspector is opened while the Highlighter is still visible and Jane quickly
        zooms in on the rule that wasn't working as she had wanted it
        to. She opens the text properties and finds that the color
        property is comign from the wrong stylesheet.</p>

        <div class="page">
            <div class="dialog">
                <h1>CSS Inspector</h1>
                <ul class="tree">
                    <li>Lorem</li>
                    <li class="expanded">Text Properties
                        <ul class="tree">
                            <li class="expanded">Color: <span>red</span>
                                <ul class="plain">
                                    <li>h1 <a href="#">wrongsheet:27</a></li>
                                    <li>h1 <a href="#">rightsheet:13</a> <span id="yellowButton" style="color:black; background: yellow">?</span></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Ipsum</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p><span data-arrowTo="yellowButton">Jane clicks the CSS Doctor button to get a quick fix to her mismatched rule.</span> Since she has already selected the exact stylesheet/property/value set and element that she wants matched up, the CSS Doctor is able to give her a direct answer about her problem. The CSS Inspector and Highlighter close and the Doctor is presented with the CSS Editor.</p>
        <div class="page">
            <div class="dialog" style="width: 600px">
                <h1>CSS Doctor</h1>
                <table style="width: 600px">
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td >rightsheet.css appears before wrongsheet.css in your HTML page. One solution is to move rightsheet.css to a place in your &lt;head&gt; after wrongsheet.css, or you could make the rule more specific (which is the safer choice, because other rules may be affected by moving rightsheet.css).</td>
                            <td style="width: 400px">CSS Editor goes here</td>
                        </tr>
