# JavaScript Workspaces Prototype #

## Summary ##

The Workspace concept began with Smalltalk environments and has been ported
to a Firefox add-on. We believe that Workspaces provide a more pleasant way
to experiment with code than the current tools which mimic a command line
environment.

The prototype will allow us to get experience with this different work style
and also give other people a chance to comment on it.
