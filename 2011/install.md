With the exception of the Web Console, which will remain where it is for the
time being, our intention is to have the Developer menu in Firefox offer just
an "Install Developer Tools" option. The user clicks that and gets the 
"standard set" of developer tools. The user will also have the option of 
opting in to beta or nightly developer tools.

# Open Questions #

1. Package that standard set as a single, prebuilt "omnibus" addon, or 
as the original collection of individual add-ons?
