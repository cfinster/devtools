The Inspector is a web designer-oriented feature that was initially planned
for Firefox 4 but was not ready in time to ship. The code was written before
the DevTools SDK and was left in an inactive state in the Firefox tree.

We are going to rebuild the Inspector on top of the DevTools SDK and plan
to take the UI in different directions than the original planned Inspector.
