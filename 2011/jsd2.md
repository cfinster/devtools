# JSD2 #

JSD is the API provided by SpiderMonkey for JavaScript debugging, and JSD2 is the next generation version of this. JSD2 is a complete overhaul designed to handle the out-of-process debugging that is a requirement for Firefox going forward.

Initial planning documentation from the summer of 2010, including a look at the proposed remote debugging protocol, is here: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/JSDebugv2
