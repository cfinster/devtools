# Mozilla Developer Tools UI #

January 25, 2011

Status: design

We will be building a variety of developer tools that appeal to different 
audiences and provide a range of features. Some web developers will want
all of the tools. Others will only want some. We want to build the tools
so that:

* users who need few tools are able to use those tools with minimal fuss
* users who need many tools will find that they complement each other well
* no one feels like they're drowning in clutter

This document is intended to describe the concepts, features and interface
guidelines that will make the tools work together.
