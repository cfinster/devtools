# Memory Tooling Backend #

## Summary ##

Ultimately, we want to be able to provide tools that give Firefox users answers to the following questions:

1. is my page taking a lot of memory?
2. if it is, how do I fix it? (where is that memory going?)
3. am I allocating too many objects? if so, where?

For the first stage, we need to identify:

1. what information we can get from the system presently
2. what work needs to be done to get the information required to answer the questions above

The goal of this project now is to get the ball rolling so that the backend can provide the information we want so that a future release can provide the user-visible tooling.

## Release Requirements ##

1. work breakdown of required platform improvements
2. implementation of those improvements
