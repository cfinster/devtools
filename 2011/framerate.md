The Framerate Monitor began life as a quick Firefox add-on that provides a 
visualization of the rendering performance of the browser. It was extended
with support for profiling with Shark which helped in identifying 
areas in which Firefox's rendering performance could be improved.

This document describes the planned evolution of the Framerate Monitor.
