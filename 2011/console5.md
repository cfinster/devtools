# Web Console "5" #

## Summary ##

With the move to timed releases for Firefox, it becomes harder to target 
specific features at a given Firefox release. However, there are some
Web Console improvements that we will strive to get into Firefox 5
and this project is tracking those improvements.

The most common complaint about the Web Console during the Firefox 4
beta cycle is the inability to move the console around (people either
want it in a separate window or at the bottom of the window).

We also want autocompletion improvements.
